Must Do
-------
1) Do not hard code the password for admin in the installDevices function.  Needs to dynamically pass that to smart things.
2) Get a deployment package setup for mac
3) Write doco on how everything works
4) publish it to the smart things community forums
5) Create a linux deployment package
6) Add https support once aspnetcore rc2 comes out


COULD NOT DO THESE
------------------
1) Can I auto add the zones/partitions to a group called security system in smart things 
	(could not find a way to do this!)
2) Why doesn't the group show the round circle on the display (none of the zones show a round circle in the display)
	(n/a - if there is no action it will just show text and not the button!)
