Must Do
-------
6) Get a deployment package setup for mac

7) Write doco on how everything works
8) publish it to the smart things community forums


Nice to Haves
-------------
3) Create a linux deployment package
4) Determine if the hub command can be sent to remote destinations.  if not, add ability to toggle between local lan call vs. normal json call from the cloud



COULD NOT DO THESE
------------------
5) Add user/password to the j64 web site
	Can't find a good way to restrict access from certain IP's

2) Can i show all of the zones on that partition page?  basically a dynamic view of those zones or something like that?
	No, going to use Rooms rather than trying to make a dynamic page

1) Can I auto add the zones/partitions to a group called security system in smart things 
	(could not find a way to do this!)

3) Why doesn't the group show the round circle on the display (none of the zones show a round circle in the display)
	(n/a - if there is no action it will just show text and not the button!)
