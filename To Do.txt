Must Do
-------
6) Get a deployment package setup for mac

7) Write doco on how everything works
8) publish it to the smart things community forums


Nice to Haves
-------------
3) Create a linux deployment package
4) Determine if the hub command can be sent to remote destinations.  if not, add ability to toggle between local lan call vs. normal json call from the cloud



DONE
----
2) also add/delete zones & partitions as they are modified in the app
1) Update device names in smart things when/if the configuration is modified
1) make the arming code a parameter.  it is currently hard coded (search for 2804)
2) fix alarmserver settings.  can't use the jsonignore attribure on the models since that data is returned from the api)
6) clean up the return codes from alarmsystem.sendcommand (right now it just says "test send" in an array list)
4) Centralize the logging of messages so they can be seen via the UI
6) Add the ability to configure the alarm system zones and partitions
1) Set the IP address of the j64 server automatically.  it is currently hardcoded
3) Can I automatically turn on alarm when set into the away/stay mode on the smart home dashboard
4) fix socket issue from below
	just added the polling logic.  we will see if that fixes the issue


COULD NOT DO THESE
------------------
5) Add user/password to the j64 web site
	Can't find a good way to restrict access from certain IP's

2) Can i show all of the zones on that partition page?  basically a dynamic view of those zones or something like that?
	No, going to use Rooms rather than trying to make a dynamic page

1) Can I auto add the zones/partitions to a group called security system in smart things 
	(could not find a way to do this!)

3) Why doesn't the group show the round circle on the display (none of the zones show a round circle in the display)
	(n/a - if there is no action it will just show text and not the button!)
